# UNIX C File System Project
# Brief Description

This project stands as an assignment from my Operating Systems lecturer in my second year of college. One may find each requirement for this assignment in either romanian or english in the "a1_ro.pdf"/"a1_en.pdf" file respectively. An autograder Python program "tester.py" is also included to evaluate how many requirements were met by the UNIX C code.

# Software Requirements and Usage:

A UNIX based system will be required. All of the source code can be found in "a1.c", and to test the functionality, one may run the program as specified in the source code, or the tester program by typing "python3 tester.py --docker" for testing the automated grade.
